# What the Chirp

Bird populations play an important ecological role as they both mitigate pests and can also themselves be pests. Because of this, monitoring bird populations provides important insights into the overall health of an ecosystem with implications for both conservation and for agriculture.

Traditionally bird populations are monitored through catch and release tagging. (Fuller et al) This has the drawbacks of being resource intensive, is invasive to the birds, and introduces sampling bias as it is difficult to ensure uniform representation across species and ecosystems.

The goal of our project is to identify birds through their birdsong to facilitate population monitoring that can be done remotely, inexpensively, and can be easily automated. These techniques can also be expanded to discover new species by looking for songs that do not match any known species.
